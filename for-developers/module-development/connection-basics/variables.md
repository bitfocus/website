Modules are able to expose values to the user, which they can use as part of the button text, or as input to some actions. This section explains how to define variables and change update their values.

The basic workflow is to define your variables using `setVariableDefinitions()`, then set or update the values using `setVariableValues()`. Both of these methods are defined by the module InstanceBase class.

## API call: `setVariableDefinitions()`

Your module can define the list of variables it exposes by making a call to `this.setVariableDefinitions({ ...some variables here... })`. You will need to do this as part of your `init()` method, but can also call it at any other time if you wish to update the list of variables exposed.

:::warning
Please try not to call this method too often, as updating the list has a cost. If you are calling it multiple times in a short span of time, consider if it would be possible to batch the calls so it is only done once.

## Variable definitions

The [TypeScript module template](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-template-ts) includes a file `src/variables.ts`, which is where your variables should be defined. It is not required to use this structure, but it keeps it more readable than having everything in one file. More complex modules will likely want to split the actions definitions into even more files/folders.

All the variable definitions are passed in as a single javascript array, in the form of:

```js
;[
	{ variableId: 'variable1', name: 'My first variable' },
	{ variableId: 'variable2', name: 'My second variable' },
	{ variableId: 'variable3', name: 'Another variable' },
]
```

:::important

VariableId must only use letters [a-zA-Z], numbers, underscore, hyphen.

## API call: `setVariableValues()`

At any point in your module you can call `this.setVariableValues({ ... new values ... })`. You can specify as many or few variables as you wish in this call. Only the ones you specify will be updated.

For example:

```js
this.setVariableValues({
    'variable1': 'new value'
    'variable2': 99,
    'old_variable': undefined // This unsets a value
})
```

:::warning

Please try to batch variable updates whenever possible, as updating the values has a cost. If you are calling it multiple times in a short span of time, consider if it would be possible to batch the calls so it is only done once.
