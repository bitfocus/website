### Bonjour discovery

Many devices use Bonjour or MDNS for discovery.

There is a new `bonjour-device` config field type that you can use to easily perform this discovery for your users as they open the configuration panel.

### Color picker

The `color` input field type now supports providing colors as `#000000` format hex strings, and can have alpha support enabled
