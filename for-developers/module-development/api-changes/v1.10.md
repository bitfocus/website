## Custom headlines for preset actions, feedbacks and steps {#preset-headlines}

Presets can now define a `headline` value for each action, feedback and step, to be used as the user editable label for the action/feedback/step.

## Array support for merging multiple Bonjour queries {#bonjour-arrays}

Inside your `companion/manifest.json`, each bonjour query defined can now be an array of queries, allowing two queries to be merged and used for one config field.

## Extended format support for feedback image buffers {#image-buffers}

The `imageBuffer` property from advanced feedbacks can now be in more formats.

To do this, there is a [new `imageBufferEncoding` property](https://bitfocus.github.io/companion-module-base/interfaces/CompanionImageBufferEncoding.html). This allows you to specify how the colors are packed in your buffer.

Additionally, the `imageBufferPosition` property has gained [a new `drawScale` property](https://bitfocus.github.io/companion-module-base/interfaces/CompanionImageBufferPosition.html#drawscale). This can be used to scale how the buffer is drawn, allowing to either match the higher resolution we now draw at, or to avoid scaling a buffer yourself.

:::tip

Make sure to not use really large buffers, as that will become a bottleneck for your module.
