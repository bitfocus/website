### Automatic invert property for boolean feedbacks {#feedback-invert}

Boolean feedbacks now automatically get an 'inverted' property added by Companion.

:::tip

If you already have an option performing a similar job, we recommend using an upgrade script to move its value into our field and remove the option.  
Alternatively, you can opt out of our field, but be aware that users may have already set values that you should try to preserve

:::

If we detect that your feedback already has an invert field, we will hide and disable ours, but this doesn't find every field
