## Automated layout for Config parameters {#config-layout}

The connection config panel allowed modules to customise the layout of input fields. This was not possible elsewhere in Companion, and is inconsistent with elsewhere within the panel where fields are in the simplified layout.

As of @companion-module/base v1.14, modules will now be presented in this consistent layout. Modules using older versions of the API will not be affected, until they update.

It is our hope that this new layout will not cause significant issues, if you have any problems or really dislike it, you can temporarily opt out of the new layout by adding to your module constructor:

```js
this.instanceOptions.disableNewConfigLayout = true
```

:::warning

This is a temporary opt out, in a few releases time it will be removed.

:::

Let us know if there is extra configurability that you need, we are open to restoring any needed functionality that is lost.

See the [PR](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/pull/3569) for more examples on the impact.

## Connection processes now include the label (name) of the connection {#connection-process-name}

To improve the developer experience, when looking at each process in task manager or activity monitor, each process is now labelled with the label of the connection.
