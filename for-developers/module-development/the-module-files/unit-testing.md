Unit testing of modules is not very common.

We find it quite hard to test most modules as to do so requires mocking-up the device connection.

If you have any suggestions on mocks, tooling or examples we should provide to make this easier, we are open to suggestions!

Some modules which are known to have some unit tests:

- [grassvalley-kaleido-solo](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-grassvalley-kaleido-solo/blob/main/index.test.js)
- [etc-eos](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-etc-eos/blob/master/main.test.js)
- [youtube-live](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-youtube-live/tree/master/src/__tests__)

Feel free to add yours here.
