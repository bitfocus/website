Before you start developing you must [install the necessary tools](../setting-up-developer-environment.md) and familiarize yourself with [contributing to Companion with Git](../1_git-workflows/github-workflow.md).

Once you have mastered these basics, continue on to the next page: [Developing Core Companion](./development-flow.md).

If you need to create your own local release of Companion, check out the instructions on the [Build page](./build-companion.md).
