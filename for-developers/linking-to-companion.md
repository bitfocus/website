If you make, sell or advertise a product which can be controlled with Companion you can place a badge referring to Companion along with it. Typically you'll want to place a badge on your product's website, but you can also use it in print.
You can download the Badge here: [https://companion.free/img/companion-badge.png](https://companion.free/img/companion-badge.png)

![Controllable by Companion](https://companion.free/img/companion-badge.png)

When integrating the badge on your website(s), you are free to host the image yourself or to link the image on our server.

Use this html to show the badge:

```
<a href="https://companion.free/?ref=bitfocus" target="_new"><img alt="Controllable by Companion" src="https://companion.free/img/companion-badge.png?ref=bitfocus"></a>
```

At the points where it says `"ref=bitfocus"` replace the word _bitfocus_ with a reference to you or your product (only letters and numbers are allowed).

You can scale the image to fit in your website, as long as it is still readable, you may not change its color, rotation, animate it or change it in any other way than scaling.

You are not allowed to:

- use this Badge without advertising a product which is controllable by Companion without a custom module
- alter the appearance of this badge
- hyperlink the badge to any other than the given site
- hyperlink the badge to bitfocus.io with redirectors or link shortening services
- use the badge in an inappropriate way
