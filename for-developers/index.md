These pages provide information for people who would like to contribute to the Bitfocus Companion Open-Source Project.

All contributors should familiarize themselves with [Git and GitHub flows](./git-workflows/git-crashcourse.md), which provide the fundamental framework for contributing and for tracking changes.

In order to develop and test code on your own computer, you will need to [Install the Developer Tools](./setting-up-developer-environment.md). From there, you can choose your path: developing a module or contributing to core companion:

- Developers wanting to contribute a module or contribute to an existing module can proceed to the [Companion Modules](./module-development/home.md) pages.

- Developers interested in contributing to the core Companion functionality should proceed to [Core Companion](./core-development/intro-to-core.md)
