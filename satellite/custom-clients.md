The Satellite protocol is intended to be a simple text based protocol, designed to allow anyone to write their own Satellite clients.

You can find a full definition of the protocol in [the Satellite API](../for-developers/Satellite-API)

### Example implementations

If you have an opensource client implementation, please share it here!

- [ScreenDeck](https://github.com/josephdadams/screendeck) operates over the Satellite protocol
