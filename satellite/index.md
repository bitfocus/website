# Companion Satellite

Companion Satellite allows you to have your physical Stream Deck and other control surfaces connected via USB to your local computer but connect them to Companion running on another remote computer.

The computers do not have to be on the same subnet or VLAN, but should be able to reach Companion via a TCP connection — whether on the same LAN or via a VPN connection.

:::danger

Do not expose Companion ports directly to the internet, this will allow anyone to control your Companion
